# MVC-Tech-Blog

## Description
This is is a project to help me understand the MVC model. The challenge is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site to be deployed on Heroku. It uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Usage
To use this application, create an account, ask questions and contribute information on technical concepts for other developers to share. If not running from Heroku, ensure you run npm install to install all the packages/dependencies. Then you'll need to run node seeds/seeds.js to create the database and then copy and rename the .env EXAMPLE code to .env with your own SQL credentials. Fianlly, use npm start to run the server.
