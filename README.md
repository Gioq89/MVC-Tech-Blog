# MVC-Tech-Blog

## Description
This is is a project to help me understand the MVC model. The challenge is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site to be deployed on Heroku. It uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Usage
To use this application, create an account, ask questions and contribute information on technical concepts for other developers to share.
